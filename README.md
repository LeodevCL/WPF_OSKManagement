WPF_OSKManagement
=================

A sample WPF application that uses an external app to spawn the native Windows 7 On-Screen Keyboard (OSK). The approach enables Win 32-bit WPF apps to fire, find and kill Windows 7 processes (OSK in this case).

Steps to compile and run:
1- Download the code
2- Open The KeyboardExecuter solution in Visual Studio and compile the app.
3- Open the KioskSampleApp in Visual Studio and compile the app.
4- Copy the KeyboardExecuter.exe file that was generated in WPF_OSKManagement\KeyboardExecuter\KeyboardExecuter\bin\Debug into C:\Users\Anthonyb\Documents\me\tech\prototyping\git\WPF_OSKManagement\KioskSampleApp\KioskSampleApp\bin\Debug
5- Run the KioskSampleApp from Visual Studio or just by double clicking the generated .exe file.

Let me know if you run into any issues.

Thanks
